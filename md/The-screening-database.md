The 'screening database' captures data generated by paired BLAST screening.

[[images/ScreeningDBschema.png]]
**DIGS screening database schema.** Circles to the left of field names indicate fields that can be used as keys to link across tables in the core schema, or to ancillary tables added for specific projects. The shaded blue and pink background indicates the combination of fields that uniquely identifies (i) target genome files and (ii) reference and probe sequences used for screening, respectively.

**DIGS screening database field definitions**

**Status table**

| Genome_ID | VARCHAR | Unique identifier for a set of target sequence files |
| Organism | VARCHAR | Name of the organism (Latin binomial) BLAST searched |
| Data_type | VARCHAR | Data type of the genome file that was BLAST searched |
| Version | VARCHAR | Version details of the genome file that was BLAST searched |
| Target_name | VARCHAR | Name of genome file that was BLAST searched |
| Timestamp | TIMESTAMP |  Timestamp of the table entry |


**BLAST results table**

Records the co-ordinates of loci in target sequence databases that contain overlapping or contiguous BLAST hits to one or more query sequences.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| Record_ID | INT | Automatically incremented primary key |
| Organism | VARCHAR | Organism name (Latin binomial) |
| Data_type | VARCHAR | Genome data type |
| Version | VARCHAR | Genome build version details |
| Target_name | VARCHAR | Name of genome data file containing the BLAST hit |
| Probe_name | VARCHAR | Name of probe sequence |
| Probe_gene | VARCHAR | Name of probe gene |
| Probe_type | VARCHAR | Type of probe sequence (amino acid or nucleotide) |
| Scaffold | VARCHAR | Name of scaffold/contig/chromosome containing the BLAST hit |

| Subject_end | INT | 3’ (end) position of BLAST hit within the scaffold |
| Query_start | INT | 5’ (start) position of the BLAST hit within the probe sequence |
| Query_end | INT | 3’ (end) position of the BLAST hit within the probe sequence |
| Timestamp | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of the table entry |


**Extracted table**

Contains the extracted sequences of the loci specified in BLAST_results table, and results of the second round of paired BLAST, in which extracted sequences are 'genotyped' by BLAST comparison to the reference library.

| Bit_score | FLOAT | Bit score of the BLAST hit |
| Identity | FLOAT | Percentage identity of BLAST hit | 
| Coeff_e_value | FLOAT | Coefficient of the expect (e) value for the BLAST hit |
| Exp_e_value | INT | Exponent (base e) of the expect (e) value for the BLAST hit |

| Query_start | INT | 5’ (start) position of the BLAST hit within the probe sequence |
| Query_end | INT | 3’ (end) position of the BLAST hit within the probe sequence |
| Timestamp | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of the table entry |
