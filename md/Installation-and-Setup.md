**The DIGS tool**

The latest version of the DIGS tool can be obtained as a zip archived from the main [DIGS-tool project page](http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/).

**Requirements**

The DIGS tool requires [PERL](https://www.perl.org/), the basic local alignment search tool ([BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastHome)), and the [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) relational database management system (RDBMS). 

The tool can be installed on any system that runs these programs, but some details may vary across platforms.

Installing the DIGS tool on a networked server will allow remote access to DIGS databases via an SSH shell and/or MySQL GUI client. On Macintosh systems, for example, the [‘Terminal’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28OS_X%29) and [‘SequelPro’](http://sequelpro.com/) applications can be used to interact remotely with the DIGS tool and it's associated screening databases. 

An ideal computing environment for installing the DIGS tool is a shared LINUX server that has BLAST, PERL and MySQL installed. Some consideration should be given to disk space and processing capacity in relation to the size of the intended screen (i.e. in terms of the anticipated number of BLAST searches and the size of the target sequence databases).

**Perl**

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language. The DIGS tool requires Perl with the [DBI](http://dbi.Perl.org/) (database interface) module installed. Installing the DBI module is usually straightforward. However, there are some well recognized issues using this Perl module on Macintosh computers. This guide includes [instructions](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool/wiki/Installing-DIGS-on-your-mac) for resolving these issues should they arise.

**BLAST**

The DIGS tool uses BLAST+, which can be obtained [here](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download).

Please follow the installation instructions distributed with the BLAST+ package.
Note: if the BLAST programs are installed, but not currently in your local path, you will need to set the correct path to a directory with the BLAST+ binaries under the $blast_bin_path variable in the pipeline.pl control script. 


**MySQL server**
 
The DIGS framework is based on the use of an [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) to manage data generated by screening, and to facilitate interrogation of this data. [MySQL Community Edition](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) is a freely downloadable RDBMS that is supported by an active community of open source developers: 

Information regarding the installation of MySQL on LINUX can be found [here](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/linux-installation.html)

**MySQL GUI client**

A MySQL client with a graphical user interface (GUI) - e.g. [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com) - is a useful tool for interacting with screening databases.
