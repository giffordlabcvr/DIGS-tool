	  Colours indicate relationships between components.
	  Genomes are uniquely is identified by a target ‘key’ (dark blue) comprised of four components.
	  The first subdirectory level (here called ‘Group’) does not form part of the key
	  (this allows genomes to be grouped at organism level by user-chosen criteria).
	  The three levels below this – ‘organism’, ‘data_type’, and ‘version’ and ‘target_name’
	  – form part of a key that uniquely identifies target files within the DIGS framework.
	  Together with the target key, four additional fields (shown in light blue) uniquely
	  identify loci recovered by screening. As shown in panel (b) probe and reference
	  sequences should encode two levels of classification in the header.

    <p>


Typically these
	  would be: (i) the name of the species from which the sequence derives, and
	  (ii) the name of the genome feature it represents, as illustrated here, but alternative
	  bipartite classification systems may be used as appropriate. The database schema (c)
	  comprises three core tables: ‘searches performed’ is used to keep track of which searches
	  have been performed; ‘active_set’ is used internally by DIGS, while ‘digs_results’
	  contains a non-redundant set of all hits obtained in the screen. A ‘consolidation’
	  process (see Fig 4b) can be executed to generate a ‘loci’ table that comprises
	  contiguous matches from the ‘digs_results’ table, based on predefined rules. 
	  DIGS screening databases can be extended with additional tables linked to the core
	  schema via specific fields. This allows SQL queries to draw on a potentially
	  unlimited range of linked ‘side-data’ when interrogating screening databases.
