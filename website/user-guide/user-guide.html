         It can be installed on <b>LINUX</b> or <b>UNIX</b> systems.
         Thus, installation on Macintosh OSX and Windows 10 and above should be possible, but I have not investigated this personally.
	   </p>


	   <p>
         <u><b>Scripting language</b></u>:<br>
         The DIGS tool requires <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perl.org/"><b>PERL</b></a>.
         The <a target="_blank" href="http://dbi.Perl.org/)"><b>DBI (database interface)
         module</b></a> should be installed via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpan.org/"><b>CPAN</b></a> if it is not part of your native PERL distribution. 
	   </p>



	   <p>
         <u><b>Similarity searches</b></u>:<br>
         The DIGS tool uses the freely available

       <hr>
       
       
       
	   <p>
          The DIGS tool requires users to set four environment variables in their home environment:
          
       <br>
	   <table>
	
		   <thead>
			   <tr>
				   <th>Name</th>
				   <th>Definition</th>
			   </tr>
		   </thead>
	
		   <tbody>

			   <tr>
				   <td><i>$DIGS_GENOMES</i></td>
				   <td>Path to the top-level of the 'target-databases' directory (see below)</td>
			   </tr>

			   <tr>
				   <td><i>$DIGS_HOME</i></td>
				   <td>Path to the DIGS-Tool directory</td>
			   </tr>

			   <tr>

			   </tr>

		   </tbody>
		
	   </table>
      <br>

   
	   </p>


	   <p>
         Note that one of the environment variables is the path to the '<b>target-databases</b>' directory.
         DIGS requires that all project-relevant sequence databases
         are contained within this directory, which has a simple, pre-defined subdirectory
         structure (see <b>section 1.3</b> below).
	   </p>


	   <p>
		 Once environment variables have been set, you should be able to run the DIGS tool
		 script with the  -h (--help) option as shown here: 
		 
  <pre>
  <code>giff01r@Alpha:~/DIGS/DIGS-tool$ ./digs_tool.pl -h</code></pre>	


   
	   </p>


	   <p>
		 This should print the DIGS input help page to the console:

		  Before we can use BLAST to screen target sequence databases, it is neccessary to 
		  'index' these files for BLAST searching.
 	   </p>


	   <p>
	     This can be performed efficiently by running the digs_tool.pl script as follows:


  <pre>
  <code>./digs_tool.pl â€“m=1</code></pre>

 	   </p>


	   <p>
         This will initiate a console-based interactive process in which the target 
         database folder is scanned, and genomes that require indexing for BLAST are identified.

	   </h3>
       <hr>


	   <p>
          To perform DIGS we require a library of FASTA-formatted sequences, called the 
          'reference sequence library'.
 	   </p>


	   <p>
          The reference sequence library is used a source of 'probes' for screening, 
          and also provides a means of classifying hits (i.e. similar sequences) identified in these screens.   
 	   </p>

	   <p>	   
          The DIGS tool uses a simple rule to capture data from the headers of
          FASTA-formatted reference (and probe) sequences, in which
          everything to the left of the last underscore in the FASTA header
          is taken as the 'species name' and everything to the right is taken 
          as the 'genome feature name'.
 	   </p>



       <p><img src="../assets/images/digs-sequence-format.jpg" alt="DIGS target directory structure" /></p>



	   <p>
          A subset of reference sequences should be selected as probes.
          The entire reference library can be used - in which case there is no need to
          create a separate file â€“ but it is often sufficient to use only a subset of
          sequences from the reference sequence library, in which case, a separate file
          containing this subset should be created.
          The path to this file is specified in the DIGS control file.

	   </h3>
       <hr>


	   <p>

          The relational database component allows efficient
          monitoring and summarising the output of screening. 
          Particularly when the screening project database is enriched with additional
          data (e.g. taxonomic data, see below) this greatly
          enhances users capacity to interrogate the data generated by screening.


 	   </p>

	   <p>
          A MySQL client with a graphical user interface (e.g. <b>SequelPro</b>)
          can be used to connect to the screening database and select view 
          the results of screening. For example, as shown below.
 	   </p>

<blockquote>
	  <b>Visualising DIGS results</b>: In the example shown above, an SQL statment is

</blockquote>
		 
       <br>
	   <p>
          As well as selecting rows, it is often useful to count rows based using
          an SQL statement with a 'GROUP BY' clause, as shown in the example below.

	   </h3>
       <hr>

 
	   <p>
		  Inspecting screening results often reveals the deficiencies of the reference
		  sequence library that was used to classify screening results. 
	   </p>


 
	   <p>
		  In particular, screening can make it clear that there are certain variants of	  
		  the genome feature being investigated that are not represented in the reference
		  sequence library.
	   </p>

		
 	   <p>
          When this happens it is useful to reclassify sequences identified via 
          screening using an updated reference sequence library that includes representatives of 
          the missing variant(s).
	   </p>

	   <p>
	   
	      To do this, simply add the new sequences to your project-specific reference library 
	      and run the digs_tool.pl script using you project control file and the -m=3 option,
	      as shown here:

     <p>
       The option to limit the reassign via a WHERE statement is presented.
       This can save time when the aim is to reassign only a subset of hits 
       in a digs_results table with a large number of entries.
       If using a WHERE statement enter it as you would in a SQL client (i.e. using
       appropriate syntax), as shown above.

	   </h3>
       <hr>


	   <p>
		  Incorporating additional, linked data tables into DIGS project databases allows
		  users to reference these data in SQL queries.
	   </p>


	   <p>
		  For example, adding a table that contains taxonomic information about the species
		  screened will allow SQL queries to reference higher taxonomic ranks than species.
	   </p>

 


       <p>
         The digs_tool.pl script provides functions for console based management of 
         additional tables. For example, to add a table with virus taxonomy, first run DIGS as follows:

  <pre>
  <code>giff01r@Alpha:~/DIGS/DIGS-tool$ ./digs_tool.pl -d=1 -i ../projects/eve/eve_1_parvo.ctl
  </code></pre>	

	   </p>

 


       <p>
         The console will prompt for input, beginning with the path to a file containing tabular data

  <pre>
  <code>Connecting to DB:  erv_lenti

	 #### WARNING: This function expects a tab-delimited data table with column headers!

	 Please enter the path to the file with the table data and column headings

	 : ../projects/eve/tabular/ncbi_virus_taxonomy.txt</code></pre>		
 	
 	
 	 </p>

     <p>
       If valid tabular input is received, a breakdown of the column headers will be shown.
       If it looks correct enter 'y' (yes), and select appropriate options. For example:
 	 </p>


     <p>

  <pre>
  <code>The following cleaned column headers (i.e. table fields) were obtained

		 Column 1: 'Target_species'
		 Column 2: 'Target_class'
		 Column 3: 'Target_superorder'
		 Column 4: 'Target_order'
		 Column 5: 'Target_family'
		 Column 6: 'Target_genus'

	 Is this correct? (y/n): y

		 1. Create new ancillary table
		 2. Append data to existing ancillary table
		 3. Flush existing ancillary table and import fresh data

	 Choose an option (1/2/3): 1

	 What is the name of the new table? : host_taxonomy

	 Creating ancillary table 'host_taxonomy' in eve_1_parvoviridae screening database

	 #### IMPORTING to table 'host_taxonomy'

	 # Exit
</code></pre>

 	 </p>


	 <p>
	   <b>NOTE</b> - in the example above I have deliberately prefixed the 
	   column names - which are taxonomic ranks - with 'Target_'.
	   This avoid conflicting with any of 
	   MySQLs <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keywords.html"><b>reserved words</b></a>
	   - one of which is 'ORDER'.
	 </p>

     <p>
       Now that I have added the host_taxonomy table, I can select
       database entries based on any of the taxonomic ranks included in my file,
       through reference to the 'host_taxonomy' table, as shown below.

	   </h3>
       <hr>

	   <p>
         When relying on sequence similarity as a means of recovering the sequences of 
         related genome features, a limitation is that the sequences of many interesting
         genome features are only partially conserved, and large regions of sequence
         within these features may be rearranged or divergent.
 	   </p>

       <p>
         However, when two or more conserved features occur contiguously, their relationship
         can be used to determine the coordinates of a more complete sequence for the 
         genome feature of interest.
 	   </p>



	   <p>
         For example, integrated retroviruses ('proviruses') are comprised of internal coding domains
         (<i>gag</i>, <i>pol</i>, <i>env</i> - in that order), flanked by terminal LTRs
         that are usually (though not always entirely) non-coding.
         However,
         endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) frequently have much complex genome arrangements,
         with many being fragmentary or mosaic in structure, and large regions of 
         the integrated provirus often being highly divergent from anything seen previously.
 	   </p>



	   <p>
         Accordingly, it makes semse to screen first using individual features 
         (i.e. <i>Gag</i>, <i>Pol</i>, <i>Env</i> polypeptides, plus LTR nucleotide sequences),
         as probes and references, then to '<b>consolidate</b>' the hits to these
         probes into a larger sequences comprised of the hits, plus the intervening sequences.
         At the same time, we can record the relationship between the component parts of
         the merged sequence, where merging occurs.
 	   </p>

	   <p>
         The DIGS tool can be used to implement a â€˜consolidationâ€™ of this kind.
         Contiguous hits in the â€˜digs_resultsâ€™ table are merged based on whether they
         are within a user-defined distance of one another.
	   </p>


        <p><img src="../assets/images/consolidate.jpg" alt="Consolidate" /></p>

 
	   <p>
           Running the consolidation process produces a set of merged sequences, and
           also classifies these sequences using the same approach applied when
           generating the digs_results table.
           The results - i.e. a non-overlapping set of sequences, merged as determined by 
           user-specified rules -  are entered into the 'loci' table
           (see the <a target="_blank" href="db-schema.html"><b>database schema page</b></a> for details).
           A separate reference sequence library that is appropriate for classifying
           the longer sequences should be used for classifying the consolidated results, and is
           specified by a distinct parameter (see section 4 in the set-up stages above).
 	   </p>


	   <p>
           The loci table contains most of the same fields as the digs_results table,
           but also includes a 'locus_structure' field that records the relationship
           between merged hits, including their orientation.
