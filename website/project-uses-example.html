	   <p>
         If you haven't decided yet whether or not you want to use GLUE, 
         you might find it useful simply to look through this tutorial, as it should
         provide useful insight into the kind of things that can be done with GLUE projects.
 	   </p>

	   <p>
         If you've already committed to using GLUE, you 
         may find it useful to also investigate the 
         <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/exampleProject"><b>GLUE example project</b></a>
         when attempting this tutorial.

	   <p>
         <b><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot">Psittacine birds</b></a> (parrots and cockatoos) are among the most beautiful and remarkable
         creatures on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these wonderful species are 
         presently endangered, and conservation efforts have been hampered by the emergence of
         <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/psittacine-beak-and-feather-disease"><b>psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)</b></a>.
  	   </p>

	   <p>
         PBFD is caused by a circovirus called <b><u>beak and feather disease virus (BFDV)</u></b>.
         BFDV is a member of genus <i>Circovirus</i>, in the  family <i>Circoviridae</i>. 
         The circoviruses form part of a broader assemblage of evolutionarily-related
         <b>CRESS DNA viruses</b>. BFDV infection is fatal for many birds, and even those that
         survive may 
         <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEYullGf0o"><b>lose all of their feathers</b></a>.
             
  	   </p>

	   <p>
         Genomic approaches have great potential to help control the spread of BFDV.
         In this tutorial we will use the <b>CRESS-GLUE</b> project to <b>(i)</b>
         investigate BFDV distribution diversity and evolution, and <b>(ii)</b> establish
         a sequence-based resource for BFDV.

		 <a id="DownloadFromNcbi" class="anchor" href="#sequenceData" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>1. Downloading all available BFDV sequences from GenBank</strong>
	   </h3>


	   <p>
         To download all BFDV entries in NCBI GenBank, we 
         will use a customised version of GLUE's  module
         <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/moduleReference/moduleType/ncbiImporter">'<b>ncbiImporter</b>'</a>       
         module. Our project-specific configuration of the module can be viewed
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/modules/genus/circo/circoviridaeNcbiImporterBfdv.xml"><b>here</b></a>.
         Viewing the file, you can probably see that it is configured to download sequences
         based on a query phrase:

	   <p>
        <i>"Beak and feather disease virus"[Organism] AND 200:2000[SLEN]</i>
 	   </p>


	   <p>        
         This 'eSearchTerm' is a standard NCBI entrez text query that
         specifies all GenBank entries labelled "beak and feather disease" in the
         'Organism' field and between 200-2000 nucleotides (nt) in length.

 	   </p>

	   <p>
         To use the module, first initiate GLUE on the command line as follows: 
         
         
  <pre>
  <code>MyComputer:CRESS-GLUE rob$ gluetools.sh 
  GLUE Version 1.1.103

  are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions. For details see

  Mode path: /
  GLUE></code></pre>


          
         Notice from the first line that I'm in the 'CRESS-GLUE' directory when
         I initiate GLUE.
         This means that, by default, it will be my 'working directory' - when I reference
         a file from the GLUE console, I'll need to do so <u>relative to this directory</u>.
 	   </p>

	   <p>
 
         Next, navigate to the 'cress' project as shown here:
	   </p>

  <pre>
  <code>GLUE> project cress 
  OK
  Mode path: /project/cress/</code></pre>

 	   </p>
 
	   <p>
         Now create the module using it's
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/modules/genus/circo/circoviridaeNcbiImporterBfdv.xml"><b> configuration file</b></a>,
         which is contained in the CRESS-GLUE project, as shown here:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress/
  GLUE> create module -f modules/genus/circo/circoviridaeNcbiImporterBfdv.xml
  OK
  (1 Module created) </code></pre>

 	   </p>

 	   <p>
         To run the module, execute the following command in the GLUE shell:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress/
  GLUE> module circoviridaeNcbiImporterBfdv import</code></pre>

 	   </p>
 	   <p>

         When I ran this command on the 1st December 2020, I obtained the following output:


  <pre>
  <code>ncbiImporterSummaryResult
  totalMatching: 1250
  present: 0
  surplus: 0
  missing: 1250
  deleted: 0
  downloaded: 1250</code></pre>

         Since the GenBank database is continually expanding, you may find
         that you obtain more sequences than this when running the same 
         command at a later date. Note that next time the module is run, only 
         the missing sequences will be downloaded. 
	   </p>
 
 	   <p>
 	     Now export the sequences to a 'source' directory as follows.
 	   

   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/cress
   GLUE> export source ncbi-curated-circo-bfdv -p sources/</code></pre>

		  The sequences are now in your local copy of the CRESS-GLUE project, under
		  './sources/ncbi-curated-circo'. However, they are in XML format - not
		  particularly convenient for human use - so how do we 
		  get our hands on the FASTA versions of these sequences?
		</p>

 	   <p>
          GLUE is designed to provide as much flexibility as possible with respect 
          to data-formatting. To export FASTA-formatted sequences from GLUE, use a
          <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/moduleReference/moduleType/fastaExporter">'<b>fastaExporter</b>'</a>       
          
          
          module. As with many of GLUE's core module types, a
          version with a default configuration can be created on
          the GLUE command line using the '-t' (template) option:
          
   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/cress
   GLUE> create module -t fastaExporter 
   OK
   (1 Module created)</code></pre>
		</p>

 	   <p>

          Now lets use this module to export the sequences in the 'ncbi-curated-circo-bfdv'
          source. Heres my first attempt:
   
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> module fastaExporter export -w "source.name = 'ncbi-curated-circo-bfdv'"
  Error: Usage error
  Usage: export (-w &ltwhereClause> | -a) [-o &ltoffset> -b &ltbatchSize>] [-y &ltlineFeedStyle>]
                [-r] [-t] (-p | -f &ltfileName>)

  Options:
	-y &ltlineFeedStyle>, --lineFeedStyle &ltlineFeedStyle>  LF or CRLF
	-f &ltfileName>, --fileName &ltfileName>                 FASTA file
	-w &ltwhereClause>, --whereClause &ltwhereClause>        Qualify exported sequences
	-o &ltoffset>, --offset &ltoffset>                       Paged query offset
	-b &ltbatchSize>, --batchSize &ltatchSize>               Paged query batch size
	-a, --allSequences                                   Export all project sequences
	-r, --suppressReverseComplement                      Suppress reverse complement
	-t, --suppressRotation                               Suppress rotation
	-p, --preview</code></pre>
  
  	   </p>

 	   <p>
          Oops - something went wrong! - the module needs another argument.
  	   </p>

 	   <p>
          Note that the <b>error message</b> prompts with the correct usage of the module,
          and an explanation of the options. In this case, I forgot to tell GLUE what to do
          with the sequences. They can be previewed in the console, or exported to a file.
          Run the module as follows to export the sequences to a file named 'bfdv.fna':
          
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> module fastaExporter export -w "source.name = 'ncbi-curated-circo-bfdv'" -f bfdv.fna
  OK</code></pre>
          
  	   <p>
          You can check how to use any of the commands associated with a GLUEs module
          using the 'help' option.

 <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> module fastaExporter help export</code></pre>

	   </h3>


	   <p>
         Now that we've downloaded a set of BFDV sequences, we can incorporate them into 
         the CRESS-GLUE project.
         Load the sequences as follows:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> import source sources/ncbi-curated-circo-bfdv/</code></pre>
 	   </p>
 	   
	   <p>
          All BFDV sequences obviously have the same taxonomic information.
          To input the taxonomic data for each sequence in the main 'sequence' table,
          we can use
		  <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleLoadSequenceDataBdfv.js"><b>this script</b></a>.
	      which utilise two GLUE commands: (1) listing all sequences in a particular source;
	      (ii) setting values in sequence table fields.
	   </p>
 	   
	   <p>
		  The script is run as follows:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> run script glue/genus/circo/exampleLoadSequenceDataBdfv.js</code></pre>
 	   
	   <p>
          Link each new BFDV sequence to the isolate table using
          <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleLoadSequenceDataBdfv.js"><b>this script</b></a>.
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> run script glue/genus/circo/exampleLoadIsolateDataBdfv.js</code></pre>

 	   </p>


	   <p>
         Extracting information from GenBank fields using a
         customised version
         of GLUE's 'genbankPopulator' module.
         We can use this module to search for for <i>host species</i>,
         <i>time and place of isolation</i>,
         and <i>isolate</i> data in the "notes" section of the GenBank XML. 
 	   </p>
 	   
	   <p>
         Use of FreeMarker and REGEX in this and other GLUE modules.
         If unfamiliar the examples included in this project can be modified. 
  
  
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> run script glue/genus/circo/exampleLoadIsolateDataBdfv.js</code></pre>

 	   </p>


		 <p>

           Inspect data in the sequence table via the command line:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> list sequence sequenceID name full_name family genus clade
  +============+===============+================+==================+==============+
  | sequenceID |     name      |     family     |      genus       |    clade     |

  | AB182570   | BFDV          | Circoviridae   | Circovirus       | Avian-1      |
  | AB182571   | BFDV          | Circoviridae   | Circovirus       | Avian-1      |
  | AB182572   | BFDV          | Circoviridae   | Circovirus       | Avian-1      |</code></pre>

  		 </p>


		 <p>
           Inspect data in the isolate table via the command line. This time using a
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp"><b>'where clause'</b></a>         
           to limit the query to Japanese isolates only:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> list custom-table-row isolate id isolate country -w "country = 'Japan'"
  +==========+============+=========+
  |    id    |  isolate   | country |
  +==========+============+=========+
  | AB277726 | AGP-SA1P-1 | Japan   |
  | AB277727 | AGP-SA1P-2 | Japan   |
  | AB277728 | AGP-SA1P-3 | Japan   |
  | AB277729 | AGP-SA1P-4 | Japan   |
  | AB277730 | AGP-SA1P-5 | Japan   |</code></pre>		   


  		 </p>

		 <p>
           Executing the query above without a where clause will show that
           not every sequence has complete information for each field in the isolate
           table. This is because typically, some GenBank entries for any given virus
           lack this information.

	   </h3>




		 <p>
           Investigating the data in the sequence table reveals that some of the 
           BFDV sequences are not associated with isolate data. This means that our
           genbankPopulator module didn't find the information in the XML file for that 
           sequence. Such inconsistent annotation of virus entries in GenBank is 
           fairly commonplace, due to a lack of standards.
  		 </p>


 		 <p>
           It's often possible to fill in missing values via reference to an 
           associated manuscript. In this section I'll show how to use GLUE to 
           coordinate this process.
  		 </p>


 		 <p>
           
           First, let's export the existing isolate table data for sequence in our source.
           This is a three step process:


  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress

  GLUE> console set cmd-output-file-format tab 
  OK
  Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> console set next-cmd-output-file bfdv-data.tsv
  OK
  Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> list custom-table-row isolate id isolate country host_sci_name collection_year</code></pre>		

		 </p>
		 <p>
           Show format for updating data - (template).
		 </p>

		 <p>
           Use       
		   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleImportCuratedSideData.js"><strong>this script</strong></a>
		   to upload the refined data.
		 </p>

		 <p>
		   If you improve metadata for any virus sequence set, you may want to share.
		   See sharing section below.
		 </p>

	   </h3>


		 <p>
		   The 'Circovirus' extension of CRESS-GLUE includes reference sequences for 
		   most (if not all) species, including BFDV.
		   The reference sequence declarations can be found
		   <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/circoReferences.glue"><b>in this file</b></a>.
		 </p>
	   
	   
		 <p>
		   However, in a project focussed specifically on BFDV, we may want to annotate this 
		   specific reference more richly - incorporating everything that is known about
		   the virus genome.
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
           Let's examine how we can modify the existing BFDV reference sequence.
           First, let's have a look at the reference sequences in the cress project.
           On way to do this is to use the
		   <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/195207/use-tab-completion-to-type-commands-faster-on-any-operating-system/"><b>tab complete</b></a>           
           function of the console to reveal the full list 
           of reference sequences, by first typing 'reference (or just the first few 
           letters of this word), and then pressing the 'tab' key, as shown here:

 		   The reference has the locations of major genome features mapped - specifically the 
		   <i>rep</i> and <i>cap</i> genes.	   
		   Inspecting the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001944"><b>BFDV GenBank entry</b></a>
		   shows that includes annotation for an additional, hypothetical open reading frame (ORF) called "V2".
  		 </p>
  		 
  		 
		 <p>
           Let's modify the existing BFDV reference ssequence to include V2. 
           First, lets examine all of the features defined in the entire CRESS-GLUE 
           project.

		 <p>
           First let's create the feature, as follows:
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> create feature v2 "v2 gene"
  OK
  (1 Feature created)
  
  GLUE> feature v2 set metatag CODES_AMINO_ACIDS true
  OK
  
  Mode path: /project/cress/
  GLUE> feature v2 set metatag OWN_CODON_NUMBERING true
  OK</code></pre>

 		 </p>

  		 
		 <p>

           Now lets associate this feature with a location in the BFDV genome:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> reference REF_Circo_BFDV 
  OK
  Mode path: /project/cress/reference/REF_Circo_BFDV</code></pre>	
  		 </p>

		 <p>

           Now we can really get to work! In the next few steps we will use everything
           we've created so far to start doing some proper comparative analysis.
  		 </p>

		 <p>
          [Advantages of the work done - ability to preserve it so it doesn't need to
           be repeated].

		 <a id="CreateAlignment" class="anchor" href="#sequenceData" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>5. Creating an alignment of all BFDV sequences</strong>.
	   </h3>

	   
		 <p>
		   A pairwise, reference-guided approach is an efficient and reliable way to 
		   align a large set of sequences derived from a single virus species.
		   The GLUE framework allows this approach to be used in a codon-aware way, and
		   without data loss.
		 </p>

		 <p>

		   At this point, I should mention that some BFDV sequences are in the opposite
		   orientation to our chosen BFDV reference. To address this, run
		   <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleApplyReverseComplement.glue"><b>this GLUE file</b></a>.
		   This will allow us to proceed directly to the alignment step with all 
		   sequences in the same orientation. Later in this section,
		   I'll explain how I created the file.


  <pre>
  <code>run file glue/genus/circo/exampleApplyReverseComplement.glue</code></pre>


		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   To create an alignment, first, exit the reference sequence to project level (assuming you are still 
		   in this mode path), as follows:
		 </p>

   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/cress/reference/REF_Circo_BFDV
   GLUE> project-mode 
   OK
   Mode path: /project/cress
   GLUE></code></pre>
	   
		 <p>
		   Before we perform the alignment construction, we need to first create 
		   a <b>constrained alignment</b> object and specify which sequences belong in it,
		   as shown here:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> create alignment AL_BFDV -r REF_Circo_BFDV
  OK
  
  Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> alignment AL_BFDV add member --whereClause "source.name = 'ncbi-curated-circo-bfdv'"
  OK</code></pre>
  
		 </p>


		 <p>
		   Now we can construct the alignment.
		   The CRESS-GLUE project contains a 
		   <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/modules/genus/circo/circovirusCompoundAligner.xml"><b>circovirus-specific configuration file</b></a>
		   for GLUE's  'compoundAligner' module.
  <pre>
  <code>compute alignment AL_BFDV circovirusCompoundAligner</code></pre>
		 </p>

  

		 <p>
		   Now let's inspect the resulting alignment. One way is to use the 
		   'show statistics' command. This will produce a table as shown below
		   (note that only the first few table rows are shown here):
  <pre>
  <code>GLUE> alignment AL_BFDV show statistics

		 </p>

		 <p>
		   Or alternatively, list alignment members, along with their associated data, like this:

  <pre>
  <code>GLUE> alignment AL_BFDV 
  OK
  Mode path: /project/cress/alignment/AL_BFDV
  GLUE> list member sequence.sequenceID sequence.name sequence.isolate.isolate

  | AB182569            | BFDV          | YCC-IN2P                           |
  | AB182570            | BFDV          | RRP-JP11P                          |
  | AB182571            | BFDV          | RRP-JP12P                          |
  | AB182572            | BFDV          | BTP-SA11P                          |</code></pre>
  
 		 </p>

		 <p>
		   (only the first few results are shown here)
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   How did I figure out which ones? There are lots of ways to do this 
		   using GLUE. In this case I used a fairly unsophisticated approach 
		   (but one that seemed to work quite well).
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   I naively aligned all BFDV sequences then inspected the alignment
		   in the console. Since we had excluded sequences shorter than 200bp when we
		   downloaded from BFDV sequences GenBank (see above), it was a reasonable guess that any
		   sequences for which the only aligned segments were drastically shorter than
		   this length were in reverse orientation relative to the reference.
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   
		   Additionally, 
		   since orientation of sequences is usually consistent within a study, it
		   wasn't particularly difficult to create a list of sequences suspected to 
		   require reverse complementation. 
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   Refining the alignment - may want to manually adjust and re-import.
		   Note, the structure of the alignments directory - refer to alignment tree.
		   BFDV is a 'tip' alignment'.
		 </p>

   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/cress/
   GLUE> import alignment -f alignments/tip/</code></pre>

		 <p>
		   Now that we have created an alignment of BFDV sequences that is constrained to 
		   the BFDV reference sequence, we can use this alignment in combination with GLUE's
          <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/moduleReference/moduleType/featurePresenceRecorder">'<b>featurePresenceRecorder</b>'</a>

	   </h3>
	   
	   <p>
         In the final step in this tutorial, we will create a set of midpoint-rooted
         tree for each of the two main genes in the BFDV genome.
	   </p>

	   <p>
         First, lets build trees for both Cap and Rep. We are going to use GLUE's
          <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/moduleReference/moduleType/raxmlPhylogenyGenerator">'<b>raxmlPhylogenyGenerator</b>'</a>       
         
         
         The entire sequence of commands for creating both trees can be found in
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleCreateBfdvPhylogenies.glue"><b>this file</b></a>,
		 which is in the CRESS-GLUE repo, as follows:
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> run file glue/genus/circo/exampleCreateBfdvPhylogenies.glue</code></pre>

		 Before you attempt this, bear in mind that we are about to build a bootstrapped,
		 maximum likelihood tree for thousands of sequences. On my computer it took 
		 over an hour to build trees for both genes.  
		 
	   </p>

	   
		<p>
		  To midpoint-root the trees, we will use GLUE's
		  module. To apply the module to the two trees we've constructed, run
		  <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleRerootPhylogeny.glue"><b>this file</b></a>
		  as follows:


  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/cress
  GLUE> run file glue/genus/circo/exampleRerootPhylogeny.glue</code></pre>

         Note that trees could also be midpoint rooted by importing them into another application
         that offers this functionality. However, it is often convenient to be able to 
         do this within GLUE.
         
		</p>
	 
 	   
		<p>
		  Export annotations for the trees by running
		  <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/CRESS-GLUE/blob/master/glue/genus/circo/exampleExportAnnotations.glue"><b>this file</b></a>,
		  as follows:


  <pre>
