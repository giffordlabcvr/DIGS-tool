# DIGS Tool

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the DIGS tool - a software framework for implementing database-integrated genome-screening (DIGS).

## Overview

DIGS is an approach for performing comparative genomic research in silico. It entails using sequence similarity search tools (e.g., BLAST) to recover sets of related nucleotide sequences from molecular sequence databases. These data are then further investigated using a relational database in combination with other analysis tools.

## Features

- **Sequence Similarity Search**: Integrate tools like BLAST to find related nucleotide sequences.
- **Relational Database Integration**: Store and manage large sets of sequence data efficiently.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize a range of tools to analyze and visualize genomic data.
- **Comparative Genomics**: Perform in-depth comparative studies across different genomes.
