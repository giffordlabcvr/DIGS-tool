# DIGS Tool

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the DIGS tool - a software framework for implementing database-integrated genome-screening (DIGS).

## Overview

DIGS is an approach for performing comparative genomic research in silico. It entails using sequence similarity search tools (e.g., BLAST) to recover sets of related nucleotide sequences from molecular sequence databases. These data are then further investigated using a relational database in combination with other analysis tools.
